# Gene_ops

Gene-ops is a simple calculator to perform
simple genetics calculations.

At the moment it can:
a) convert a dna string given by user to a complementary sequence.
b) convert a dna string into an complementary RNA sequence
c) conver RNA strings to proteins.

Additional functions are planned.
This version doesen't have any checking mechanisms, 
so in case of wrong sequence it won't work correctly.
